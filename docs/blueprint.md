## Core Features:

- Informational Pages: Landing page with clear sections and a contact form, offering quick links to About, Services, Workshops, and Contact pages.
- Interactive AI Chatbot: AI chatbot powered by Vercel AI SDK initiates conversation, gathers user info, and uses a tool to tailor the response and summarize needs to generate a proposal.

- Accent color: A deeper orange, such as #D45500, can highlight key elements and calls to action.
